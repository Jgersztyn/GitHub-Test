# GitHub-Test
I have mostly use Bitbucket, so this is a test to get myself familiar with GitHub.
Likely I will only use GitHub in the future.

I have been coding four about 4 years now. Very soon I will finish my degree in Computer Science, along with a minor in GIS.
Java is my most familiar language, but C# is likely my favorite language to write in. I also know languages such as Python, C++, Haskell, JavaScript, CSS and HTML.

Looking forward to learning more and contributing to great projects!
